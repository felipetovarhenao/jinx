[ 'title' "moment of symmetry scales" ]
[ 'description' "This example explores Erv Wilson's 'moment of symmetry' (MOS) scales. A MOS scale is any scale that can be generated by repeatedly stacking the same interval a given number of times (i.e., the generator) within a given range (i.e., the period) — typically the octave —, such that the resulting scale only contains two different step sizes. The most common example of a MOS scale is the diatonic scale, since it contains two different step sizes (2212221), the generator being the perfect fifth, or it's inverse, the perfect fourth." ]
