[ 'title' "combination product sets" ]
[ 'description' "An interface for exploring Euler-Fokker genera and Erv Wilson's theoretical construct of combination product sets (CPS). CPS's are ratios can be generated by multiplying all possible k combinations out of a larger set of n unique elements. If all elements are prime and greater than 2, and include at least one repetition (i.e., a multi-set), the resulting ratios are considered considered an Euler-Fokker genus and not a CPS."]
