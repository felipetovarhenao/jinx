[ 'title' "spectral analysis" ]
[ 'description' "This example performs a spectral analysis and symbolically transcribes/approximates any provided sound, drawing inspiration from approaches to microtonality in spectral music. Caution is advised when attempting to analyze audio samples longer than 1 minute, as it might takes several minutes to process. This example is an adaptation of the '22. Audio Transcription' example from the ears~ package by D. Ghisi and A. Agostini." ]
