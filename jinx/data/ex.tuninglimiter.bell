[ 'title' "limit-based ratio approximation" ]
[ 'description' "This example provides a way to approximate cents to ratios for a given prime limit. Given a list of cents and some user-defined constraints, such as prime limit factor and ratio complexity, the interface returns one of virtually many possible ratio approximations for the list of cents."]
