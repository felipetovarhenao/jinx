[ 'title' "limit-based cents-to-ratio approximator" ]
[ 'description' "This example provides a way to approximate cents to ratios for a given prime limit. Given a list of cents and some user-defined constraints, such as prime limit factor and ratio complexity, the interface returns one of virtually many possible ratio approximations."]
